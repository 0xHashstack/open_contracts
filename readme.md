# Open protocol

> An autonomous lending framework enabling under-collateralized loans for upto 1:3 collateral-to-debt ratio.


### About Open

DeFi lending today requires a borrower to provide collateral that exceeds the actual borrow. This diminishes the utility of decentralised lending. Open protocol's proposed solution enables borrowers borrow upto 3 times their collateral. Open is the only product in the market today capable of implementing a defi lending solution that is comparable to traditional finance

## Concept 
[Hashstack](https://hashstack.finance)'s Open protocol encourages productive lending. Productive lending is when the money is borrowed to boost personal finances. When [Hashstack](https://hashstack.finance) lends, it assumes that the borrowers use the funds productively to earn a profit so that they can pay the lender back while keeping some extra earnings to themselves. When the loan is outstanding it is an asset for the [Hashstack](https://hashstack.finance) and its depositors, while a liability (debt) to the borrower. When a loan is repaid, the assets and liabilities disappear, and the exchange is good for both the borrower and creditor.

Open permits a collateral-to-debt ratio of upto 1:3, i.e. a borrower can seek a loan upto $300 usd against $100 usd collateral. CDR is a simple formula to calculate.
## 𝐶𝐷𝑅 = 𝐶𝑢𝑠𝑑 ÷𝐿𝑢𝑠𝑑

- 𝐶𝐷𝑅 = 𝐶𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙 𝑡𝑜 𝑑𝑒𝑏𝑡 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜
- 𝐶 𝑢𝑠𝑑 = 𝐶𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝑈𝑆 𝑑𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑠.
- 𝐿 𝑢𝑠𝑑 = 𝐿𝑜𝑎𝑛 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝑈𝑆 𝑑𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑠.

### Supported tokens
During its early operational period, Open protocol will support BNB, USDC, [STACK](https://bscscan.com/token/0xeac61d9e3224b20104e7f0bad6a6db7caf76659b) as acceptable denominations for deposit, borrow & withdrawal. This means, an account can deposit tokens, or borrow in these denominations only. ****
