# Open protocol

> An autonomous lending framework enabling under-collateralized loans for upto 1:3 collateral-to-debt ratio.


### About Open

DeFi lending today requires a borrower to provide collateral in excess of 42% to that of the actual loan. This diminishes the usecase of decentralised lending. Open protocol's proposed solution facilitates loan upto 3 times the collateral. Hashstack's Open protocol is the only practical application of under-collateralised lending in DeFi.
